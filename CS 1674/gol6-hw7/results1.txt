The accuracies were:
1) Pyramid representation - 0.5600
2) Level 0 representation - 0.4150
3) Level 1 representation - 0.5350

The level 1 representation performed better than the level 0 representation because with strong features, single-level representation accuracy maintained strong.
However, what should theoretically occur is accuracy declines after a certain point, and level 0 representation should have better accuracy. 
This can be attributed to the fact that the specific descriptors chosen by level 0 mattered less than others that may be found.
The combined pyramid representation had the most accuracy in test predictions because pyramids tend to perform the best as opposed to single-level representations (they have more robust training input).
