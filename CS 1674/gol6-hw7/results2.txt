As the K values increase, KNN Test Accuracy starts at a high amount of acccuracy and then overtime drops slightly.
Meanwhile KNN Train Accuracy,starts at a very low accuracy and increases steadily and levels off.
Both SVM Test Accuracy and SVM Train Accuracy remain constant.

Also, as K increases, the accuracy evens out for all methods. 

As K increases, SVM train, KNN train, SVM test and KNN test, have the best accuracies, ranked from greatest to lowest.
SVM train has the highest accuracy, as it maximizes the margin between samples, resulting in more accurate classifications.
