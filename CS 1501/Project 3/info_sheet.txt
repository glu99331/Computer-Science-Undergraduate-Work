Does your program run without error?:
Works to my knowledge. There still may be possible bugs during 
testing, I hope that my code is up to par, as I have many hours
testing this code.

To my knowledge, the program works fine, and complies to the Project Description.
The only possible errors may be due to UI, or improper error handling.

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
N/A

Additional comments to the grader:
I have opted to be more specific with handling user input, the program will tell the user that
they have entered an invalid input, and prompt the user to enter again. 

I have also decided to display additional messages, which differs slightly from the sample output, to make it clearer for the user of invalid
inputs, warnings, and allow the user to be aware that the program interprets the user to be starting another word. Functionality-wise, the 
program works fine. In regards to the UI, it may still contain bugs, but I have extensively tested the code, spent countless hours, and hope
that the code I have created, and thought through is up to par.
 
I have also decided to create a user-friendly program. This program will continuously prompt 
the user to enter a valid input until the user enters one of the valid options. The program 
will only exit if the user decides to enter NO. This program efficiently handles
cases of the User inputting the wrong input, and displays the appropriate message boxes.
- Please be way that there may or may not be some unhandled cases in regards to user input.
